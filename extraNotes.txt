Mazda 3 Sedan 

Purcahsing out my lease 

Manuel 
257 w/ gap

700 dollars 


Just to take a look at the premium sedan 


minus taxes and other stuff, I'm at 9,695 for cost of the car, minus the amounts that I paid for maintiance 
15,982 current offer for contract 
14,747 is the buyout offer
=


addition of total finacned after market 2,995.00

addtional work as well would be aded to it 


Total cost of car 25,703

25,703
+ 672

89x? 672
lets say

The one really big sussy thing is the added price for this one added fee, what is non negotiable with that item...




Then we can see the buy out prices 



new Mazda, drives pretty well. The turbo sounds nicer (how much of that audio is pumped in tho), the heads up display is nice, does not do a lot, but it replaces the need to look at my dials 
The extra cameras are nice, really nice to have all that added context and visability
They use shiney metal vs the more matte finished metal, still feels kinda plastic-y though 
The two tone interior is nice
The seats feel pretty much the same

New car would cost the follo
