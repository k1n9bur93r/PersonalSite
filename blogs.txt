Hello World, PING 
This is a start.
This is the first message used to build the simple blog file
---12/3/23
Good day, PONG
Need something to demo?
And this is the second message needed to show that we can indeed parse...

Start of Day Two
templates and rendering
Day one was kinda slow, but most of it was building the idea that I want to implement today, I think I will be able to execute quick with this.

Wowowow
gotta deal with the cat
Okay I kinda mindfucked myself a little bit here, if I can get out of this knot I invented something epic

Booyah!

I took this way farther than I expected today, I created a new object called dynaElement that can take in a generic object and a generic template and return a document fragment that has all of it's values bound. how cool!!!

Putting a Bow on it
How well can we scale our design?
Going to bed last night my mind was so focused on the idea of createing a 'dynTemplate' style page that is able to accept a series of data elements, and html templates and can exert more control how dynElements are rendered. I think I can build off of what was made before to get that working within an evening.

oops.
cringe.
Sometimes I code the most stupid things without realizing what I am doing. I focus too much on creating setters and getters I realize I'm not actally doing anything lol.

Okay yeah things got kinda weird for a moemnt, they still are, but I've been able to expand my conept a bit, made a lot less progress 2nite, don't really have anything to show. BUT I have a lot of gold nuggets I just need to parse out from this

Siri Shortcut Posting
Hell yes
I need to refine this more, but i can post kinda quickly from my phone.

Siri Shortcuts!
Keep it local
I have a Siri shortcut that I can trigger with my iPhone’s action button. It throws up input UI for the blog entries and copy’s a blog to my keyboard I bet I can get even more clever with this…
---12/6/23
Hehe
I love this 
So raaaaad

Crazy
This one feels a bit more close to home, for obvious reasons. It’s all so senseless.

---12/6/23
Hey Aus
Look at this!
All automatic, took my doing time tonight to get this shortcut polished

Dealership day
What to do
I’m getting pressured to buy out my old lease, need to figure out if/how I can haggle the price down

---12/7/23
Mmm ice cream
Long day
I had one big thing I needed to do today, but had three mini things and one medium thing so I didn’t really have that much time for my main thing. I’d say I’m at like 50% I just hope that most of the heavy lifting happened today rather than tmrw. Idk if I will work on the templates 2nite :(
